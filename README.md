Create a simple react application in typescript:
[x] Must be able to display all models created in backend correctly
[x] Must implement the actions created in the backend ie editing and creating entries
[x] Must display a dynamic list
[ ] Must implement redux
[x] do not worry about styling
[x] Implement navigation if you have time

Create a node express server in typescript:
[x] Create as a rest api
[x] Must have a user model â€“ simple authentication
[x] Must include a many to one relationship ( A user can make many posts.)
[x] Must include many to many relationship ( Posts can have many likes)
(example post has many users who like it and user can like many posts)
[x] Must be able to create update delete each type of object
[ ] Preferably use a typeorm to manage the database
[x] Recommend framework https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress , not required to use this if you are more comfortable using others or building your own.

Deployment
[x] Both client and server must be deployed and connected,
[x] Deployment server heroku
[ ] Submission, allow us access to git repo

## VS Code Debug Configuration

### Launch Server

For debugging server / backend Typescript source in `src` folder. No JavaScript files will be transpiled to disk.

### Launch Server (Watch)

Same as `Launch Server` configuration but in watch mode. Server will restart and VS code will re-attach when source has changed.

> Note: In launch configuration `"program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon"` can be replaced by `runtimeExecutable": "nodemon"`, however the `nodemon` process will not be terminated when debugging is stopped.

### Launch Browser

Debug source files in `src-client` in Google Chrome browser. `webpack dev server` has to be started first (using `npm run dev:client`).

### Launch All

Starts debug configuration `Launch Server` and `Launch Browser`.
